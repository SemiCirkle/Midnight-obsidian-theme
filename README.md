# Theme Midnight

"If there is one thing I like to look at, it's something nice."  -- Me (of course)
This is the sentiment behind every feature, color and theaming that led to the creation of Midnight. I have been using Obsidan both on mobile and desktop for about 3 years now, but I have found that the default Obsidian Theme is kind off... *off*.

>Theme Midnight is a dark theme with some flair added. **Featuring custom tags, custom footnots, embeds with text scrolling, custom bullet lists, and much more!** So while we're at it, let's talk features.

## Features and Changes

- Custom colors (of course)
- *Slightly* increased header size
- Increased size of inline title
- Custom bullet list
- Changed tabs
- Changed explorer
- Changed graph view
- Made file name (not inline) at the top less distracting
- Graph View currently opened file is easy to find
- Changed colors to code in code blocks
- Italic and bold text colors are *just enough* as highlight, but *not enough* to be too much
- The carret is colored!! (...as per your own color accent set in the settings, does not sadly work outside of main editor)
- Strikethroughs make the text dark
- Tags are more **fancy**
- Footnotes are **even more fancy**
- Changed command palatte colors
- Embedded notes no longer fill up the entire page, but rather can be scrolled inside of. Say goodbye to "not-wanting-to-embedd-note-because-it-too-long" reasons, it even has the file name as a title!
- Header letter spacing increased *very slightly* to provide better readability
- Blockqoutes have a border around them
- Callout blocks are more colorful
- Tables are now **facny** with their new background colors
- File previews are bigger, fitting more content
- And finally: Slight increase to readable line width to fit more context onscreen

Note that this theme does not support a light version.
